# How to Run the Program:
- execute the following steps in this order:
1. Open two terminals; termA and termB
2. In termA run: bash install.sh 
3. After that finishes, in termA run: python3 main.py
4. Once that is running, go to termB and run: ./triangle-app-v1.0

# Notes:
- There seems to be some weird bug where the transducer doesn't receive and respond to the "documentReady 0" - which is the first transition we have. 
- The fix seems to be to close the triangle app with the "x" in the top right corner and stopping the main.py file with "ctrl+c". Then following the execution steps again.
- We have seen that it usually resolves itself on the second run through the steps.
